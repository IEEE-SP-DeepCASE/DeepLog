DeepLog
=======

The DeepLog class uses the `torch-train`_ library for training and prediction.
This class implements the neural network as described in the paper `Deeplog: Anomaly detection and diagnosis from system logs through deep learning`_.

.. autoclass:: deeplog.DeepLog

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. automethod:: deeplog.DeepLog.__init__

Forward
^^^^^^^

As DeepLog is a Neural Network, it implements the :py:meth:`forward` method which passes input through the entire network.

.. automethod:: deeplog.DeepLog.forward

Predict
^^^^^^^

The regular network gives a probability distribution over all possible output values.
However, DeepLog outputs the `k` most likely outputs, therefore it overwrites the :py:meth:`predict` method of the :py:class:`Module` class from `torch-train`_.

.. automethod:: deeplog.DeepLog.predict
